# Cyphercon 3.0

I had the incredible opportunity to attend the Cyphercon 3.0 conference with
talks about cryptography, and computer security.

This year's theme was nostalgia for the telephreak era of hacking. Telephreaking
is exploring telephone solutions for weaknesses. Also known as phone "hacking".

# Badge
The digital badge is an interactive circuit board that among other things
contains a modem allowing attendees to make land line calls from the badge.

I know the [tymkrs](http://tymkrs.com/) personally, they created this year's
electronic badge and was part of their setup crew. The badges have
a lot of features in multiple modes.

# Conference

Despite "working" assembling badges I was able to attend some talks and they
were really good. Also got to talk with the other "hacker villages" about their
specific areas of interest.

One village was "biohacking" and introduced a substance that when melted in the
mouth bonded to your taste buds and made everything taste sweet. People were
consuming things that were bitter, hot sauce, and vinegar and only tasting
sweet. I was able to give it a shot and first tried a lemon which tasted sweet
not sour, next I tried pineapple and it never tasted so sweet! Then I drank some
apple cider vinegar and even that tasted sweet and good. Eating sourpatch candy
was deliciously sweet as well! Finally the biohacker gave me some cheap whiskey
and this substance made the cheap whiskey taste very good! I was very impressed.

The substance is glyco (something) and grows in South America and Africa. It
has not yet been approved by the FDA but you can apparently buy it on Amazon
like everything else.
