Ben is a Midwest Gaming Classic alumni and physical hacker modding hardware. He
used the Internet to gain fame and customers. His first big hit was a portable
hand held Atari 2600.

He warned:  
If your hobby becomes your job, then you have to find a new hobby.

His talk was trying to inspire hackers of all kinds. Find a way to make things
work for the masses. No solution is too silly. He showed a picture where he
made a lid for his opened can of SPAM.

Keep innovating, and don't give up!  
1. If you hack it they will come.
2. No hack is too stupid. Go for it, lots can come from one idea.
3. Never stop hacking.

Why do we still need hackers when there is so much cool stuff already?
* Large companies focus on large market. Not niche use cases.
* Hackers take risks that large companies will not.
* Hackers live in the real world, not the marketing bubble.

The earth is all we have to work with.

Warning: Try not to be obsessed with your mobile phones, they are very
difficult to mod and therefore disposable.
