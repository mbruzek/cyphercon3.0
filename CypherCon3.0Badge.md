# CypherCon 3.0 Badge

The CypherCon 3.0 electronic badge is an interactive circuit board with a
modem. The tymkrs built a phone company in a box.

They put phone drops in all the villages where people could plug their badges
in and dial numbers that may resolve on the Private Branch Exchange (PBX).

The documentation for the phone can be found at
[HackTheBadge.com](http://hackthebadge.com/cyphercon-badge-3-0-documentation/)
and the tymkrs had printed out some hard copies of this documentation for the
conference attendees.
